## Name
The project involves setting up a recommender system based on Collaborative filtering algorithms in python.

## Description
The objective of this project was to create a powerful and scalable recommendation system.

To do this, I used an algorithm called Item-Based which consists of taking an item, looking for users who liked this item and recommending items liked by these users (it takes an item and returns a list of items) . Usually it's used to say "Users who liked this also liked..."


## Installation
Extract data from data.rar archive and copy to /datas folder

Activate a virtual environment and enter the command:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the installation of the packages is complete, you can launch the script with the following command:
- python or python3 main.py

## Usage
This project shows the design of a model for recommending movies.
